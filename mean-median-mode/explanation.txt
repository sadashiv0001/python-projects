Mean
The mean is the average value of all the values in a dataset. 
To calculate the mean value of a dataset, 
we first need to find the sum of all the values and then divide the sum of all the values by the total number of values. 

Median
The Median is the middle value among all the values in "sorted order". 
Here we need to calculate the mid-value of all the values in a dataset. 
But before calculating the Median, we need to arrange all the values in sorted order. 

There are two different ways of calculating the median value:

method-1
when the total number of values is even: Median  = [(n/2)th term + {(n/2)+1}th]/2

method-2
when the total number of values is odd: Median = {(n+1)/2}th term


Mode
Mode is the most frequently occurring value among all the values.
